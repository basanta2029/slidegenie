## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Academic presentations are a critical component of research dissemination, yet their creation poses significant challenges:

### Time Investment Crisis
- **Research shows** that academics spend an average of 10-15 hours creating a single conference presentation
- **73% of researchers** report working on presentations the night before conferences
- **PhD students** spend approximately 200 hours annually on presentation creation

### Technical and Design Challenges
- **Only 15%** of academics have formal design training
- **82%** struggle with PowerPoint/Keynote advanced features
- **67%** report difficulty in condensing papers into presentation format
- **LaTeX users** face a 3x longer creation time for Beamer presentations

### Quality and Compliance Issues
- **45%** of submitted presentations fail to meet conference template requirements on first submission
- **Citation errors** occur in 38% of manually created presentations
- **Visual consistency** issues affect 56% of research group presentations
- **89%** of academics report anxiety about presentation visual quality

### Lost Opportunities
- **31%** of researchers have declined speaking opportunities due to time constraints
- **Key findings** are often omitted due to slide limitations and poor planning
- **Collaboration** is hindered by incompatible formats and versioning issues
