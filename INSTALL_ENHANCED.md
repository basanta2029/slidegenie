# Enhanced Features Installation Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

Your SlideGenie application is working with basic features. To enable enhanced AI-powered image analysis and semantic similarity, install these optional dependencies:

### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Core enhanced features
pip install sentence-transformers torch

# Optional: For better GPU performance (if you have CUDA)
pip install sentence-transformers torch torchvision
```

### Option 3: Lightweight Installation

If you want to save space and only need basic improvements:

```bash
pip install transformers huggingface-hub
```

## 🎯 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Basic Mode | Enhanced Mode |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Image Analysis** | Filename-based | AI Vision API |
| **Similarity Matching** | TF-IDF | Semantic Embeddings |
| **Context Awareness** | Basic | Position-based boosting |
| **Threshold Quality** | 0.3 minimum | 0.4 minimum |
| **Performance** | Fast | More accurate |

## 🔧 What's Already Improved

Even without additional installations, you now have:

✅ **Higher similarity threshold** (0.3 vs 0.2) for better matches  
✅ **Context-aware boosting** based on slide position  
✅ **Improved content generation** with higher token limits  
✅ **Better error handling** and partial content recovery  
✅ **Smart model selection** (GPT-4 for complex presentations)  

## 📋 Installation Status Check

Run this to see what's available:

```bash
python -c "
from utils.enhanced_content_analyzer import enhanced_analyzer
print('✅ Enhanced analyzer loaded successfully')
"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import errors**: Install missing dependencies one by one
2. **Memory issues**: Use CPU-only versions: `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
3. **Slow installation**: The models are large (~1GB), be patient

### Fallback Behavior:

The app automatically falls back to basic functionality if enhanced features aren't available. No features are lost - they're just simpler.

## 🎉 Ready to Use

Your SlideGenie app is fully functional right now with significant improvements! Enhanced features will activate automatically when dependencies are available.

Run your app with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Enjoy the enhanced slide generation experience! 🎯
